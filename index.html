        <p>Situated on the North Tyne River, around six miles north of Hexham,
            Chollerton is a tranquil village that is surrounded by beautiful views of the northern English countryside.
            It is the perfect destination for anyone who is looking for a relaxing escape from the regular bustle of
            everyday life, and therefore we are trying to keep this same feeling when you visit us at Chollerton
            Tearooms. The tearoom is an excellent place to stop by and take in the scenic views as you talk with friends
            and family over a cuppa. We also have many other facilities available,
            not just a tearoom! If you're thinking that a tearoom may not be for you,
            then we have a great selection of other types of facilities to visit and enjoy.
            These, along with the tearoom of course, are detailed below.</p>

            <img class="facilityImages" src="images/tearoomImage.png" alt="Image of snacks provided in our tearoom">
            <p class="facilityDescriptions">The tearoom is the classic quintessential aspect of any visit to the English
                countryside. Our tearoom is one of the best in the North Tyne Valley, and is famous for its scenic views
                and a wide selection of tea, coffee, other drinks and snacks. We also offer a selection of breakfast and
                lunch options which cater to almost anyone's need. This is a great place to stop by and relax after a
                long journey north (or south, depending on where you came from!) and just enjoy the atmosphere.</p>

            <img class="facilityImages" src="images/generalStoreImage.png" alt="Image of the interior of our general store">
            <p class="facilityDescriptions">Bringing you back to the <i>"olden days"</i>, this general store has kept all of its
                charm that it used to have during the 20th century. There is a large variety of things available in this
                humble little store, from jars full of sweets to hand-crafted ornaments. Needless to say, there is always
                something for everyone to buy! Keep an eye out for special offers on certain items when you visit, as they
                are cropping up all the time. We also offer a loyalty card to returning customers who wish to get a permanent
                10% discount on every purchase from all of our facilities, so if you like us a lot, it may be wise to
                consider this!</p>

            <p class="facilityDescriptions">Take your memories with you in the form of a souvenir when you leave us and travel
                back home. If you're coming from outside of the UK, we have plenty of UK-wide souvenirs that contain many
                shades of red white and blue. We also have Norhumberland and Hexham-specific souvenirs that those who are
                already living in the UK can enjoy. </p>
