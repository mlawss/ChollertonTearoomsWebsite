        <h3 class="subHeader1">Security considerations</h3>
        <p class="facilityDescriptions">One of the security risks that will have to be considered for this website is who can access the admin page
        and who cannot. I have not implemented any system to prevent any 'normal' users from accessing this page, which
        is of course a massive security risk as anyone can access the database records of the business and potentially
        tamper with them. Therefore there should be a roles system in place so that only the administrators of the website
            and the owners of the business can access this page and therefore access the database records.</p>

        <p class="facilityDescriptions">Another security risk to consider when using this website is conformation to the Data Protection Act. When a user
        requests for more information and puts their personal contact details into Chollerton's database, it must be ensured
        that the data is not kept for longer than is needed in this database and is immediately discarded once more information
        is provided to the user and the user is happy. Overall, the main security risk is to consider how the database and its
        records should be stored, accessed and handled.</p>
